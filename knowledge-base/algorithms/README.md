# Topics Index

This is a reverse index of algorithm training problems organized by topic. Each topic lists the problems that cover it, making it easy to find problems for specific algorithm concepts.

## How to Use

- Browse topics to find problems that practice specific algorithm techniques
- When registering a new problem, add it to all relevant topics in this index
- The most relevant topic for each problem is typically the primary technique used in the optimal solution
