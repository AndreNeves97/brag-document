Here are some tips and guidelines to write resumes. Some of them are based on my own experience, and some of them are based on the information I found on the internet.

# Resume tips

## General tips

As a hiring manager, I’m not sure what “a valid resume” is, but I would encourage you to not use a copy of your LinkedIn profile as a resume.

Your LinkedIn profile should be your online *curriculum vitae* (CV). It should include everything you might want a recruiter to find using a keyword search, along with some information about the context of what you’ve done, and recommendations from people who have worked with you. LinkedIn is the best place to promote your CV.

A resume is NOT a CV. Where your CV should be all about you, your resume should be all about the job you’re applying for. A resume is a very highly tailored marketing brochure, targeting a specific job opportunity. Your resume should reflect only what you bring to the job, as described in the job posting. You should never create a resume that’s all about you and send it to multiple employers. That’s the best way to get your resume sent to the trash.


## Highlighting the most important points

Reza a lenda que recrutadores levam somente 30 segundos lendo cada Resume.

Por isso é importante que você consiga destacar os pontos mais importantes logo no início do documento.

Para cumprir esse objetivo, sempre uso o "Summary" no meus resumes.

Gosto de trazer 3 bullet points focados em convencer o leitor a continuar a leitura.

Para o primeiro, você pode mencionar sua profissão / cargo que pretende concorrer + anos de experiência + principais tecnologias e abordagens.

Ex.: "𝙂𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙩𝙝 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙈𝙖𝙣𝙖𝙜𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝟳+ 𝙮𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙚𝙭𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙙𝙧𝙞𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙨𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣𝙪𝙚 𝙜𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙩𝙝 𝙩𝙝𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙡 𝙊𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, 𝘾𝙍𝙊, 𝙋𝙖𝙞𝙙 𝙈𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙖, 𝘾𝙍𝙊, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝘾𝙍𝙈."

Para o segundo e o terceiro, vale trazer um resumo de grandes conquistas:

"𝙇𝙚𝙙 𝙢𝙪𝙡𝙩𝙞𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙘𝙞𝙥𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙧𝙮 𝙩𝙚𝙖𝙢𝙨 𝙛𝙧𝙤𝙢 𝟱 𝙩𝙤 𝟯𝟬+ 𝙟𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙤𝙧 𝙩𝙤 𝙨𝙚𝙣𝙞𝙤𝙧 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙛𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙨 𝙞𝙣 𝙙𝙞𝙛𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝘽𝟮𝘾 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙖𝙣𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝟮𝙈+ 𝙢𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙖 𝙗𝙪𝙙𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙨"

Obs.: repare que uso sempre o que as vagas na minha área buscam para a minha posição: capacidade de liderança, conhecimento em canais de marketing.

Tempero isso com big numbers reais que chamam atenção.

Pra fechar, deixo na imagem abaixo um exemplo para a área de tecnologia.

## Lenght

A concise, targeted resume shows recruiters your ability to synthesize, prioritize, and convey your most important achievements. Top senior-level candidates have resumes between 450 and 850 words long (~1-2 pages).



# Tips for resumes and profile presentation

General tips that should be used in resumes and in any profile presentation, like:
- Resume for a job application (Sumary of experience, skills, and achievements)
- LinkedIn profile (More detailed summary of experience, skills, and achievements)
- GitHub profile (Projects and contributions)
- Personal website (Projects and contributions)


## No buzzwords and clichés
Don't use any ineffective buzzwords or clichés, such as 'team player' or 'results-driven',

## Usage of numbers and metrics

You should add hard numbers into your resume.

Recruiters are looking for evidence of impact, and hard numbers help with this. To explain this,
let's compare these two lines:

- Weaker: In charge of creating new processes and improving communication between departments.
- Stronger: Managed a process re-engineering project to improve and consolidate end-to-end service processes; restructured communication flow among 10 departments and cut down paperwork by 75%.

Notice how using hard numbers emphasizes the impact of your work — this is what
recruiters look for on your resume. Let's now work through your own resume...


## Remove Weak Words

You should remove weak action verbs from your resume.

Avoid words like: Work With, Responsible For, Contributed, Helped, Worked, Responsible, Was, Assisted and Worked With.

You should replace these words with stronger alternatives.

Instead of:
- Assisted, use Facilitated, Co-ordinated, or Influenced
- Contributed, use Facilitated, Co-ordinated, or Influenced
- Helped, use Facilitated, Counselled, Influenced, or Mediated
- Responsible, use Preparing, Developing, or Implementing
- Responsible For, use Pioneered, Established, or Initiated
- Was, use Developed, Prepared, or Improved
- Work With, use Liaise with, Advise, or Persuade
- Worked, use Prepared, Developed, or Implemented
- Worked With, use Liaised, Advised, Addressed, or Persuaded


## Use of bullets

Though, there might be a couple of lines in paragraph form that you might want to change to
shorter bullet points.

Here's an example from your resume: [Company Name] is an EdTech that is focused to make education accessible to all people, through business partners, such as internet providers, who pay to provide free access to the app for their customers. Its main product is the [Product Name], available on Play Store, App Store, and as Web App.

Recruiters may find a long line like this hard to read, so consider splitting it up into multiple bullet points to help your achievements stand out.

That said, it's fine to have 1 or 2 short paragraphs on your resume — just make sure they're no more than 2-3 lines long.


## Filler words

You should remove unnecessary filler words and adverbs from your resume. These words just take up space and can often be replaced by more specific examples (e.g. numbers/metrics), or removed from your resume.

Filler words used: some, several, in addition to.




## Remove personal pronouns

It is a standard in resumes to omit personal pronouns. You should remove from your resume personal pronouns like: I, my, Its, It, their, it, me and them.

- Before: I managed a 5-member cross-functional (product, engineering, sales, support) team and we coordinated with my company’s six business partners toward the successful launch of our ecommerce platform.

- After: Managed a 5-member cross-functional (product, engineering, sales, support) team and coordinated with six business partners toward the successful launch of an e-commerce platform.



## Remove passive voice

Consider rewriting passive voice sentences to the active voice, which not only increases your resume's impact but also makes it clearer and more concise.

Passive voice examples:
- Customer satisfaction was improved by 25%
- 25% increase in customers was achieved by the company with new marketing strategy
- New manufacturing processes was implemented for ABC company

Active voice examples:
- Improved customer satisfaction by 25%
- Increased customers by 25% by implementing new marketing strategy
- Implemented new manufacturing processes for ABC company

In more technical terms, the active voice describes a sentence where the subject performs the action stated by the verb. In passive voice sentences, the subject is acted upon by the verb.
