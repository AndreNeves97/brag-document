## Topocart — Desenvolvedor(a) Frontend (Angular & React)

- **Company:** Topocart
- **Position:** Desenvolvedor(a) Frontend (Angular & React)
- **Start Date:** 2026-02-21
- **Status:** Rejected
- **Last Update:** 2026-02-21
- **End Date:** 2026-02-21

### Outcome Details

- **Final Status:** Rejected
- **Reason:** Lack of direct experience with **GeoJSON** and spatial data handling.
- **Learnings:** 
    - The role was heavily focused on GIS (Geographic Information Systems).
    - Even with strong **Angular** and **React** skills, the specific domain knowledge of **GeoJSON**, **OpenLayers**, or **Leaflet** was a hard requirement for this position.
    - Consider adding a small project or study notes on **GeoJSON** and mapping libraries to the `knowledge-base/` to bridge this gap for future GIS-related opportunities.

### Process Summary

### Job Posting Details

- **Location:** South Carolina, United States (Remote/Hybrid potential)
- **Company Type:** Engineering/Mapping/GIS
- **Requirements:** Angular, React, Frontend development.

### Job Requirements

- **Technical Skills:** **Angular**, **React**.
- **Soft Skills:** Collaboration, problem-solving.
- **Responsibilities:** Develop and maintain frontend applications using Angular and React.

### Profile Match Analysis

- **Strengths:** 
    - Expert in **Angular** (v2+ to v17), matching the primary requirement.
    - Solid experience with **React** (Hooks, Context API), fulfilling the secondary framework requirement.
    - Strong background in modernizing legacy systems and architecting scalable frontends.
- **Gaps:** 
    - **GIS/Mapping Experience:** No direct experience with libraries like **OpenLayers**, **Leaflet**, or **deck.gl**.
    - **Spatial Data Handling:** Limited exposure to GeoJSON, WMS/WFS protocols, and coordinate reference systems (CRS).

### Interview Preparation

- **Key Talking Points:**
    - Migration from AngularJS to **Angular 16** at **TechCorp** (demonstrates framework expertise).
    - Experience with **NgRx** for state management at **WebSolutions** (crucial for complex GIS apps).
    - Component library development at **StartUp Inc** (useful for building custom map controls).
- **Strategy for Gaps (GIS/Mapping):**
    - **Bridge the Gap:** Frame your experience with large datasets and real-time updates (WebSockets at StartUp Inc) as a foundation for handling live spatial data.
    - **Conceptual Knowledge:** Study the difference between Raster and Vector layers, and how **OpenLayers** or **Leaflet** integrate with Angular/React.
    - **Learning Agility:** Highlight your ability to quickly master new domains, like the migration at TechCorp, to show you can ramp up on GIS quickly.
- **Topics to Review:**
    - **GIS Fundamentals:** GeoJSON structure, Layers (Tile, Vector), and basic Map interactions (Zoom, Pan, Feature Selection).
    - **Mapping Libraries:** Basic integration of **OpenLayers** or **Leaflet** in Angular (using `ngx-openlayers` or direct DOM manipulation).
    - **React & Angular Coexistence:** How to manage state or share components if both frameworks are used in the same ecosystem.

### Questions to Ask

- How is the balance between **Angular** and **React** in the daily workflow?
- Does the team use specific GIS-related libraries like **OpenLayers**, **Leaflet**, or **deck.gl** for the **GEO360** platform?
- What are the biggest challenges in visualizing large-scale territorial data on the web?
- How does the frontend team collaborate with the GIS specialists and data scientists?
