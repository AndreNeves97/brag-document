#### Strengths

#### Weaknesses


I have a strong sense of conviction when I hold an opinion, which can occasionally make it challenging for me to accept a different perspective from others. However, I've learned that this is an opportunity for personal growth and development.

I recognize that when I encounter differing opinions, it's important for me to understand the underlying reasons and the fundamentals behind those viewpoints. I actively seek to have a deeper understanding of the other person's rationale and purpose, as it allows me to broaden my perspective and consider alternative viewpoints.

To address this, I've been working on improving my active listening skills and fostering open and respectful communication. I strive to create an environment where diverse opinions are valued and where I can engage in constructive discussions to reach common ground. I'm also actively seeking feedback from colleagues and mentors to help me gain different insights and challenge my own assumptions.

While it can be a challenge when time constraints prevent in-depth discussions, I am committed to adapting and finding the most efficient ways to grasp the fundamentals and work collaboratively, even when I may not completely agree with a particular viewpoint. I believe that by remaining open-minded and continuously learning, I can effectively navigate situations where differing opinions arise and contribute to a more inclusive and collaborative work environment.

### What Do you have to offer to our company?

I always take care about the code quality of applications that I work. I like to study about better application architecture and improve my programming skills.

For example: In previous roles, I contributed to several technical improvements in legacy applications. I improved a lot of legacy implementations, applying clean code and clean architecture approaches.

Besides this, I contributed to fixing numerous high-priority bugs.

My work is led by the quality mindset: We shouldn't negotiate code quality, we should negotiate scope and deadlines.
